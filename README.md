# HUD_Experiment

**Purpose**: 
To test XAML Capability to create transparent, work-through UI.

**Working**: 
This project uses a UserControl that is present within the project to display latest updates in Market News using a RSS Feed. 
The user can scroll through the feed. The project uses a custom algorithm to decipher the RSS XML File from the source using XMLNodes.
The RSS XML File is accessed directly from the internet link. Using the ComboBox, user can select from a list of topics they wish to 
read news on.

As you can see, the HUD uses a transparent background. This enables see through HUD and we can even access stuff behind the 
HUD App, as long as they are visible. The images are also loaded now on the left side of the article for visual purpose.
