# HUD_Experiment

Purpose: To test XAML Capability to create transparent, work-through UI.

Working: This project uses a UserControl that is present within the project to display latest updates in Market News using a RSS Feed. 
The user can scroll through the feed. The project uses a custom algorithm to decipher the RSS XML File from the source using XMLNodes.
The RSS XML File is accessed directly from the internet link.

Screenshot: Will add soon.
